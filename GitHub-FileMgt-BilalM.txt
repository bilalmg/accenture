I Created a New GitHub Repository:

I visit GitHub.
I log in to my GitHub account.
I Click on the "+" Sign in the Top Right Corner and select "New repository."

I Fill in the Repository Details:

I choose a repository name, such as "AccentureCloud-FileManagement-APIs."
Optionally, I add a brief description.
I choose the visibility (Public) based on my preference.

I Initialize the Repository:

I can choose to initialize the repository with a README or add a .gitignore or license later. I decide to proceed without these for now.
I Create the Repository:

I click the "Create repository" button to create my new repository.

I Push My Local Code to the Repository:

In my terminal, I navigate to the directory where my Flask application code is located.

I initialize a Git repository if I haven't already:

git init

I add my files to the repository and make an initial commit:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

I connect my local repository to the one I created on GitHub:

git remote add origin <repository_url>
I replace <repository_url> with the URL of the GitHub repository I created in step 3.

Finally, I push my code to the GitHub repository:

Copy code
git push -u origi
