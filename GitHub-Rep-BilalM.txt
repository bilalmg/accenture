Action 1: I Created a GitHub Repository

I started by going to GitHub and signing in to my GitHub account.

I then clicked on the "+" sign in the top right corner and selected "New repository."

Action 2: I Filled in Repository Details

In the "Repository name," I gave it a name, such as "Accenture-Cloud," which is fitting for my project.

I provided a brief description and chose the visibility of the repository (Public or Private) based on my preferences.

Action 3: I Initialized the Repository

I had the option to initialize the repository with a README file, but I decided to edit this later to match my project structure.

Action 4: I Cloned the Repository

To work on my project locally, I opened a terminal and navigated to the directory where I wanted to store my project.

I then ran the following command, replacing <repository_url> with the URL of my newly created GitHub repository:

git clone <repository_url>

Action 5: I Created the Directory Structure

Within my local repository, I created the necessary directory structure. Here are the commands I used:

cd Accenture-Cloud
mkdir diagrams
mkdir documentation

Action 6: I Added Files to the Repository

I placed my architecture diagram file (SysArchBilalM.txt) in the diagrams directory.

I also put my explanation document (CloudArch.docx) in the documentation directory using these commands:


mv path/to/SysArchBilalM.txt diagrams/
mv path/to/CloudArch.docx documentation/

Action 7: I Committed and Pushed Changes

With my files in place, I added, committed, and pushed these changes to my GitHub repository:

git add .
git commit -m "Added architecture diagram and explanation document"
git push origin main

Action 8: I Edited the README

I edited the README file, now named AccentureCloud-BilalM-Readme.md, to provide an overview of my project, instructions.
