Create a GitHub Repository:

I visit GitHub.
I'm already logged into my GitHub account, which is "bmughal786."
I click on the "+" sign in the top right corner to create a new repository.
Fill in Repository Details:

For the repository name, I choose "AccentureCloud-Security-Measures."
I add an optional brief description.
For visibility, I select "Public" as I want to share this security document with others.
Initialize the Repository:

I leave the options for initializing the repository with a README, .gitignore, and license unchecked for now.
Create the Repository:

I click the "Create repository" button to create the new repository.
Upload My Document:

After creating the repository, I click on the "Add file" button to upload the Accenture Cloud security measures document. I might also create the document directly on GitHub if I prefer.
Commit Changes:

Once the document is uploaded, I commit the changes to the repository. I provide a commit message to describe the changes, such as "Added Accenture Cloud security measures document."
